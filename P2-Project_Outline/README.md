# Skedule_App
LiftOff Personal project for LaunchCode codecamp

## Overview
My project will be a scheduling app that helps users confirm and compare availability with a group of people in order to schedule a get together or trip. Users will be able to create an account, or log in, import, or sync, a calendar where their schedule is saved, and confirm availability before comparing with the group chosen. They will be able to review availability, by change it before confirming.
I decided to make this project because a group of my girlfriends and I do a girls trip every year and it always takes a few months just to schedule when to do it. Outside of girls trip, itâ€™s hard to hang out at any other time because of our different schedules. I want to be able to get everyone's availability and compare it to each other so we don't have to go person by person, back and forth on dates that work for some but not others. This application can be beneficial for anyone that needs to schedule a large get together or trip and doesn't want to just text or email back and forth for days, weeks or months in order to figure it out.

## What I'll Have to Learn
I will learn how to make a Java project from scratch, since all of our projects have been pretty much started for us. I am learning how to use Trello, which will help me break down my project into steps and keep organized. I also have to learn how to use bootstraps to their full potential and React in order to have a better handle on the front end needs, and not have to do a whole css file from scratch.
